## Bloom filter

A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not â€“ in other words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set". Elements can be added to the set, but not removed.
